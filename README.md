Minecraft PVP Match Tool

The executable version of the program (main.exe) is located in the "dist" directory

This program is NOT made for any major PVP minigames on major MC servers such as Hypixel, etc. This program is instead for a MC PVP minigame that was made by a friend,
and is intended for use with a smaller audience.

To Note:
- some inputs are not protected (they will take any input type and just break down the entire program) :D
- spaghetti code :D
